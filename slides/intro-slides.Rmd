# Why R?

## Features | Source: https://www.r-bloggers.com/on-the-growth-of-cran-packages/

R is an extremely flexible and (with the help of add-on packages) powerful language.

![](http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/files/rplot03.svg)

## Scalability

As datasets have grown, so has the importance of efficient computing.

- R was designed for efficiency - lots of 'leg-work' done in C
- R is conducive to cloud and parallel computing
- Easy to parallelise

## Visualisation | source: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/GIS4TA

- Vital for communication
- Increasingly interactive

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://tgrg.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/crispin_map.png")
```


# The R language

## R as a giant calculator

```{r, eval=FALSE}
5 * 5
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1 + 4 * 5
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
4 * 5 ^ 2
```

## Functions and objects

**In R:**

- Everything that exists is an object
- Everything that happens is a function

E.g., load a data object and find its dimension:

```{r}
data(mpg, package = "ggplot2") # load the object mpg
dim(mpg) # use a function (dim) to do something with it
```

## Objects

- R is *object-orientated*
- Objects persist in memory for the duration of the *session*
- Objects are usually assigned by the `<-` or `=` operator (usually identical)
- Any names can be give to R objects, except special characters like `\`
- Exercise: what do these commands do?

<div class="columns-2">

```{r}
a = 1
b = 2
c = "c"
x_thingy = 4
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a + b
a * b
a + c
a / x_thingy
```

</div>

## Adding and removing objects

```{r}
ls()
x <- x_thingy
rm(x_thingy)
x
ls()
```

## Functions

"R, at its heart, is a functional programming (FP) language. This means that it provides many tools for the creation and manipulation of functions."

- All functions have brackets (to run)
- The *arguments* of the functions go in the brackets

```{r}
replicate(n = 3, expr = x)
exp(x)
```


## Basic plotting

```{r}
x = 1:9
y = x^2
plot(x = x, y =y) 
```


## Demonstration then exercise: Getting used to RStudio and R

> - Open RStudio and have a look around
> - Create a new project
> - Create a new R Script: pass code to the console with `Ctl-Enter`
> - Use R as a calculator: what is:
> - Explore each of the 'panes'
> - Find and write down some useful shortcuts (`Alt-Shift-K` on Windows/Linux)

# R/RStudio tricks

## Printing the result during assignment

```{r}
# Assignment of x
x <- 5
x
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# A trick to print x
(x <- 5)
```

## The console or the script pane?

- Is it part of a longer story that will ultimately be shared? (use script files)
- Is it just playing that does not need to be stored? (use the console)

You can switch effortlessly between them with `Ctl+1` and `Ctl+2`.

## Assignment

- Be warned: easy to overwrite data

```{r}
x = 5 # the same as x <- 5
(x = x + 1)
```

## Choosing packages

- With [so many packages](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/01/cran-10000.html), simply choosing the right package can be hard work!
- Fortunately there are well-known ways to decide on which package to use (see [section 4.4 of Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html#package-selection)):
    - Is it mature?
    - Is it actively developed?
    - Is it well documented?
    - Is it well used?
- It's worth spending the time thinking about this: can save you hours later on

## Getting help

- As described in [Chapter 10 of Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/learning.html), one of the most important R programming skills is *learning how to learn*
- A great advantage of R is its strong community
- R's internal documentation is terse but good - try this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?plot
vignette("plotexample")
```

- It's worth being aware of different help forums:
    - [stackoverflow.com/](http://stackoverflow.com/) and related sites such as [gis.stackexchange.com/](https://gis.stackexchange.com/)
    - [Email lists](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html) such as [r-sig-geo](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-geo)
    - Increasingly: GitHub issue
    - Good old fashioned email


## Exercises (in groups)

- Think about the kind of data and analysis you'll be using R for
- Which packages have you be using to date? (if any)
- Find 3 packages that could help: think about pros and cons
- What are the alternatives to R for this work?
